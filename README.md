# GarlicFusion
Metroid Fusion inspired theme for GarlicOC

==========================================

First release of this theme. It's organized a little differently than most themes, so functionality is a little different. For one, the over/underclock icons are near the middle (as well as the time). All labeled are also removed, since I'm pretty sure everyone knows how to use this by now. The whole bottom guide is also different. And for reasons I can only assume are related to the previous changes, the GarlicOS version number simply does not display.

Just drop the contents of the zip into CFW, it'll add the font to the font directory, and overwrite the English.json for those settings.
